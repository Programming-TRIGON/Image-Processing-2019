# Geometry

`Geometry` contains various geometrical and mathematical functions that perform calculations needed
throughout the Ovl Module 

The full list of functions:

- `sin` - sine function that uses degrees.

- `cos` - cosine function that uses degrees.

- `tan` - tangent funcion that uses degrees.

- `calculate_math_expression` - returns the result of the expression with the given value.

- `get_circle_area` - calculates the area of a circle with the given radius.

- `distance_between_points` - calculates the distance between to given points

- `get_fill_ratio_straight` - returns the ratio between the area of the given contour and the area of the straight bounding rectangle.

- `get_fill_ratio_rotating` - returns the ratio between the area of the given contour and the area of the rotating bounding rectangle. 

- `get_fill_ratio_triangle` - returns the ratio between the area of the given contour and the area of the bounding triangle.

- `get_fill_ratio_circle` - returns the ratio between the area of the given contour and the area of the smallest enclosing circle.

- `get_contour_center` - returns the x, y coordinates of the center of a given contour (center of mass, average of distances from edge).

- `n_polygon_angle` -  returns the inner angle of a regular convex polygon (regular polygon) with n sides.

- `n_polygon_area` -  returns the area of a regular convex polygon (regular polygon) with  given n sides and length .

- `get_approximation` - returns a list of x, y coordinates of the approximation of the vertices of a given contour.

- `circle_rating` - a rating of how close a contour is to being a circle.
